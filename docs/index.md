        <h2>Empowering flight dynamics engineers</h2>
        <h4>Powerful, open-source tools for mission design and analysis</h4>
        <p>As a flight dynamics engineer, you need to plan maneuvers, analyze spacecraft trajectories, and quickly turn around orbit determination solutions. Most options are proprietary, clunky, expensive, and slow.
        </p>
        <p>
        <span class="emph">Nyx is different.</span>
        <ul>
        <li>Trajectory planning - Targeting and optimization, low thrust or not</li>
        <li>Orbit determination - Gauss Markov noise models, and state-of-the-art autodiff for all orbital dynamics</li>
        <li>Interoperable - uses CCSDS standards and open formats (parquet, yaml)</li>
        <li>Free and open-source - no expensive licenses</li>
        <li>Analysis - plots are finally interactive</li>
        </ul>
        Plotting some residuals (dots dots dots!)

        <h2>Built for speed, automation and scalability</h2>
        <h4>Simulate more, faster, from your desktop to the cloud</h4>
        <p>Nyx was built from the ground up to leverage advancements in computer science for space mission design. Our focus on performance, automation, and cloud/HPC-readiness provide insights for any operational scenario.</p>
        <p>
        <span class="emph">Unlock the future.</span>
        <ul>
        <li>Simulate and analyze ten thousand spacecraft in high-fidelity in 90 seconds on a standard desktop</li>
        <li>Automate repetitive tasks like report generation, data processing, and simulations</li>
        <li>Python API for easy integration into your automated pipelines and workflows</li>
        <li>Deploy across architectures from a laptop to the cloud for massive scaling</li>

        <h2>Reliable, tested and documented</h2>
        <h4>Even the examples from the documentation are tested</h4>
        <p>Nyx provides a robust astrodynamics library tested against real-world scenarios and well documented to support your mission from planning to operations. You can also discuss solutions directly <a href="https://github.com/nyx-space/nyx/discussions">with the community</a>.</p>
        <p>
        <span class="emph">No more obsolete documentation</span>
        <ul>
        <li>Documentation uses the proven Di√°taxis method to orient users</li>
        <li>Hundreds of tests validate calculations, methods and outputs</li>
        <li>Approachable syntax and interactive visuals foster understanding</li>
        <li>Lower risk through transparent verification and validation</li>
        </ul>
