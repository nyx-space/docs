# Firefly Blue Ghost lunar lander is powered by Nyx Space and Rust

On 02 March 2025, Firefly will attempt to land Blue Ghost 1 on [Mare Crisium on the Moon](https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/3671): follow the [live stream on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChEuA1AUJAY) and refer to the [official website](https://fireflyspace.com/news/blue-ghost-mission-1-live-updates/) for live updates.

**The [Nyx Space libraries](../../index.md), all built in Rust, power the (space)flight dynamics toolset for the mission.**

## ANISE for trajectory related computations

NASA's SPICE toolkit has been an integral part of lunar and interplanetary missions since the 1980s. ANISE is a fully-feature rewrite of SPICE, with many additional capabilities, including the addition of [azimuth, elevation, range (AER) computations](../../anise/tutorials/Tutorial%2004%20-%20Computing%20Azimuth%20Elevation%20and%20Range%20data.ipynb), safe multi-threading thanks to Rust, and of course both a Rust and Python interface. On Blue Ghost, ANISE is used generating data products for all subsystems from the trajectory file built by the flight dynamics team (FDO). Among the many firsts, ANISE correctly [predicted the first eclipse](https://nyxspace.com/nyxspace/MathSpec/celestial/eclipse/) to within less than one second than when it actually occured.

## Hifitime for time synchronization

The FDO team, led by Chris Rabotin (author), requires that maneuvers be executed within 100 ms of the planned time. A timing error means that the position of the Earth, Moon, Sun, or any other relevant celestial object, is not exactly where the maneuver execution planning expected it at maneuver time: this is mission critical. Moreover, time ticks at a different rate in cislunar space than it does on Earth: trajectory data uses the [Ephemeris Time (ET)](../../hifitime/index.md#time-scales) time scale for that reason, but ground systems are synchronized to UTC clocks. ANISE is used to compute the light-time from the Blue Ghost spacecraft to the contemporaneous ground station when accounting for the appropriate [aberration](../../anise/reference/api/python/index.md#class-aberration) and Hifitime is used for time scale conversions.

## Nyx for orbit determination

Spacecraft which fly above the GPS orbit cannot use the GPS satellites for positioning. Instead, they rely on ground-based orbit determination and FDO engineers. Nyx shines in orbit determination, as demonstrated by the [Lunar Reconnaissance Orbit example](../../nyxspace/showcase/04_lro_od/index.md). Nyx is a blazing fast high fidelity spaceflight dynamics library, and can model multiple non-spherical gravity fields, solar radiation pressure, and of course aberration corrected gravity accelerations. It can ingest the CCSDS TDM standard format for spacecraft tracking data directly into the orbit determination process for Kalman filtering.
