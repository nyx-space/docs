# ANISE - Documentation

I'm excited to announce the first release of ANISE's documentation suite, now available in three key components: Tutorials, Explanations, and a detailed Reference section, all structured according to the Diataxis framework. Whether you're new to astrodynamics or looking to deepen your understanding, our tutorials and explanations offer a hands-on approach into that thrilling world above the skies, powered by ANISE's modern capabilities.

The Reference section is the heart of our documentation, featuring the API references for both Python and Rust, alongside a comprehensive mathematical specification for orbital element computations (Keplerian, geodetic, and more). This ensures that users not only have access to powerful tools but also the knowledge to apply them effectively in designing groundbreaking missions. While I'm still working on the How-Tos, this suite is an important step towards making complex astrodynamics accessible to a broader audience, and <a href="https://7ug5imdtt8v.typeform.com/to/neFvVW3p" target="_blank">I'm eager for your feedback</a>.

By adopting a community-driven approach, we aim to democratize spaceflight dynamics, making it as open and accessible as academic research. This marks a significant step in our mission to empower flight dynamics engineers with the tools and knowledge to focus on mission uniqueness, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in space exploration. Join us in exploring the new frontiers with ANISE's comprehensive documentation suite.
