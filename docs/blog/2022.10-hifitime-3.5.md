# Hifitime 3.5

Hifitime 3.5 has been released. In addition to a [large number of improvements](http://127.0.0.1:8000/hifitime/changelog/#350), it adds a Python package.

It's with that Python package the following figure was generated:

--8<-- "includes/time-scale-deviation-tdb-et.html"

I also took this opportunity to revamp the Nyx website in preparation for a few big announcements.

You can now install hifitime directly with [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/hifitime/) .
