# IEEE SMC IT - Open source workshop

Nyx was presented during the open-source workshop of the IEEE Space Mission Challenges in IT (SMC IT) conference! This is very exciting as it's the first public presentation of Nyx. <strong>Thanks to Amalaye Oyake</strong> from Blue Origin for that opportunity!

For this presentation, I wrote up a quick introduction to using Nyx for orbit definition and propagation using version `1.0.0-beta.1`. As of today, `1.0.0-beta.2` is very close to being released, over 90% of the work being done.
