ANISE is a modern rewrite of the NAIF SPICE toolkit. ANISE provides a toolkit and files for **A**ttitude, **N**avigation, **I**nstrument, **S**pacecraft, and **E**phemeris data.

ANISE is fully validated against SPICE by executing the same instructions in SPICE and in ANISE, and ensuring that the output matches.

Installation of ANISE is trivial:

=== "Python"

    ``` sh
    pip install anise
    ```

=== "Rust"

    ``` sh
    cargo add anise
    ```
