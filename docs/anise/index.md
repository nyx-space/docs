ANISE is a modern rewrite of the NAIF SPICE toolkit, with many additional features. ANISE provides a toolkit for **A**ttitude, **N**avigation, **I**nstrument, **S**pacecraft, and **E**phemeris computations.

Answer questions like _what will be the elevation of the Moon from a ground station on 21 Dec 2033_, or _will visible-light cameras on my spacecraft be able to image a given location in 3 orbital periods_.

## Documentation

This documentation aims to follow the [_Diataxis_ method](https://www.diataxis.fr/).

+ [Tutorials](./tutorials/index.md)
+ [Explanation](./explanation/index.md)

Lots more documentation is needed, and don't hesitate to request some by [creating an issue on Github](https://github.com/nyx-space/anise/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Documentation&projects=&template=documentation.md&title=).

## Validation

Refer to the explanation on [validation](./explanation/validation.md).

## Resources / Assets

For convenience, Nyx Space provides a few important SPICE files on a public bucket:

+ [de440s.bsp](http://public-data.nyxspace.com/anise/de440s.bsp): JPL's latest ephemeris dataset from 1900 until 20250
+ [de440.bsp](http://public-data.nyxspace.com/anise/de440.bsp): JPL's latest long-term ephemeris dataset
+ [pck08.pca](http://public-data.nyxspace.com/anise/v0.4/pck08.pca): planetary constants ANISE (`pca`) kernel, built from the JPL gravitational data [gm_de431.tpc](http://public-data.nyxspace.com/anise/gm_de431.tpc) and JPL's plantary constants file [pck00008.tpc](http://public-data.nyxspace.com/anise/pck00008.tpc)
+ [pck11.pca](http://public-data.nyxspace.com/anise/v0.4/pck11.pca): planetary constants ANISE (`pca`) kernel, built from the JPL gravitational data [gm_de431.tpc](http://public-data.nyxspace.com/anise/gm_de431.tpc) and JPL's plantary constants file [pck00011.tpc](http://public-data.nyxspace.com/anise/pck00011.tpc)
+ [moon_fk.epa](http://public-data.nyxspace.com/anise/v0.4/moon_fk.epa): Euler Parameter ANISE (`epa`) kernel, built from the JPL Moon Frame Kernel `moon_080317.txt`

You may load any of these using the `load()` shortcut that will determine the file type upon loading, e.g. `let almanac = Almanac::new("pck08.pca").unwrap();` or in Python `almanac = Almanac("pck08.pca")`. To automatically download remote assets, from the Nyx Cloud or elsewhere, use the MetaAlmanac: `almanac = MetaAlmanac("ci_config.dhall").process()` in Python.
