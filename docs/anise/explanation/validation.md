[![ANISE Validation](https://github.com/nyx-space/anise/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nyx-space/anise/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

ANISE undergoes a rigorous validation process, meticulously detailed in the Validation step linked above. This comprehensive workflow involves running parallel queries in both ANISE and SPICE (in single-threaded test mode using the `rust-spice` crate by Gr√©goire Henry) for precise comparison.

Specifically, it includes the validation of 101,000 BSP queries against the DE440.BSP file. Additionally, we validate 7,305 queries for each frame in the PCK08 file, covering every day across a span of 20 years. This is complemented by an extensive series of rotations from the Earth's high-precision BPC file. This thorough and detailed validation process ensures that ANISE meets the highest standards of accuracy and reliability as expected by high profile missions.
