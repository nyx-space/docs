Nyx aims to be a free-software alternative to JPL Monte. This section demonstrates some of the capabilities of Nyx. By design, Nyx supports a plethora of scenarios which are poorly supported by NASA GMAT or STK's Astrogator[^1].

Each showcased example is categorized and detailed. Relevant source code will be published when possible. Nyx is mainly used for novel research and development whose results offer a competitive advantage. Therefore, it may not be possible to publish the source code and only some final results may be shown.

    The more examples the better! So contact me to add yours!

    _Why?_ It demonstrates the versatility of Nyx, thereby increasing its usage. This helps the overall astrodynamics community and shows yet again the power of free software.
