# Overview
This section provides the mathematical specification of all the computations in Nyx and the verification and validation results. You may independently re-run the V&V from the GMAT scripts if that strikes your fancy.

If you'd like to report an error, request additional details on some computations, or add a validation test case, please contact me at one of the links on the bottom of the page.

Refer to [this page](https://gitlab.com/nyx-space/nyx/-/issues) for all of the upcoming new features and [this page](https://gitlab.com/nyx-space/nyx/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=kind%3A%3Abug) for the list of known bugs.

??? check "Validation"
    Yay! You found the box which will detail the V&V for a given section. It's hidden by default to not overload the page with tables.
