# Overview
This section provides the mathematical specification of all the computations in Nyx and the verification and validation results. You may independently re-run the V&V from the GMAT scripts if that strikes your fancy.

If you'd like to report an error, request additional details on some computations, or add a validation test case, please contact me at one of the links on the bottom of the page.

!!! Methodology
    This MathSpec was written from the Nyx source code: the code was inspected and the relevant equations rederived from this. Please also check the [validation](/validation/) section of this website to see how Nyx was validated with the help of NASA GMAT.

??? check "Validation"
    Yay! You found the box which will detail the V&V for a given section. It's hidden by default to not overload the page with tables.
