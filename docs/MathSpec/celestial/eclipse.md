# Eclipse
The eclipse computation method is an original method not found in the literature.[^1] However, the computations are validated against GMAT. The line-of-sight computation, as detailed below, is from Vallado 4th. edition.

In summary, we compute the intersection of the circles formed from the apparent radii of the light source and the eclipsing body. This method is applicable to any light source and any eclipsing body which is a geoid. However, it _assumes_ that the geoid is spherical, so this will return an incorrect value for celestial bodies who aren't nearly spherical.

## Derivation

## Special case: line of sight

[^1]: Surprisingly I could not find many references on how to compute this.
